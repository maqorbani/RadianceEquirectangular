# RadianceEquirectangular
This repository presents a script with which one can render [Radiance](https://www.radiance-online.org) equirectangular luminance-based images using the rtrace command.

This work is built upon the workflow presented by [Dion Moult](https://thinkmoult.com/create-360-vr-panoramas-with-radiance.html) using the modified version of .cal file created by [Mark J. Stock](http://markjstock.org/).
